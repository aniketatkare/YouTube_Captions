hi guys this is pearce with sparkfun engineering and today im going to show how to assembly the estaolite its a realy cool el panel its waterproof and its  supre bendable and works great in clothing so now we have all our parts in fornt of us if you are doing anythibng diferent then what we are doing here today go on the tutorial on learn.sparkfun.com and itll explain a little more into using the t connector uh using multiple straight conectrs things like that for this were just going to use the 3 by 5 elastolite lamp the 3 feet of iron on circutry the two strait connectors witht the two peices of iron on tape the polex connector with the expoesd wires and of cours the inv 1333 the tools you will ned iare layed out in front of me youll need an iron the iron needs to bes to cotton youll need a hoby knife wax paper if your not going to iron this into a garmet the first thing were are giing to prep is the two inches of iron on tape were going to fold of ter the peice of tape and then cut it into giving us two one ince parts this is going to go on the outside of the strait connectors to makesure it can be ironed into ght garmet so now we are going to trim the molex leads theres 4 leads but only 2 of them actually have any current flowing through them the two leads we are gong to want are the red and the tan lads the other two we are going to clip off next we are going to trim the leads on the three feet of iron on circutry we are going to make 3 incision in the iron on part of the circutry be suer not to knick the thread parts cause that can lead to a premature failure of the circuit. were going to firmly pull the sheathing off so we can expose the two threads the one side the one side thats gong to connect to the lamp were going to want to  trim about quarter of an inch the tothre side that is going to connect to the molex connector wer thre quarteres of an inch to an inch so now ere going to make the connector that connects between the molex connector to the iron on circutry were going to need the two straing connectors and the two peices of iron ont apre weere going to set down the first peice of iron on tape stickey side up if you cant figure out what the stickey side is hold it firmly between your two fingers and rup it back and forth the stick side will stick to your finger whereas the other side will slide around then we are going to put down the straight connecter on top of it your going to want to put the straight connector down so the letters up are facing you so you can read the word up this means that the uh part thats going to bond witht tghe other side of the straignn connecotr is facing inward once you have these two in place your ging to want to put down the exposed trhreads from the ironon circutry and the two exposed wires from the moelx conn once you have those in place theyll make a sloid connection yourgoning to put the other string connecotr on top once thats in place your going to want to put a finlal pecinc of inron on tape on top of it now that you have that all toghet we can iron it to bond the conneciotn hold it on anywhere from ten to 20 seconds be shure to provide only minimum force you want gravity to be doing the owrk you souldnt be pushing at all now you need ot make the conneciton between the ironon circutkry and the lamp your going to put the iron on curicutyr and place it right over the two conneciton points comming off the elastolite lamp it should be the two grey splotches that are off on the color border once you put that down and the circutry is in place your going to take the connecion point s that came with the lamp and put those on top of it makeing sure the circutry is sandwitch between the two once everyting is in place thete you just inron it on just lke the other one put just a littke bit iof on the point s and wait for the bond to happen your going to need to cover up the oter connection point on the lamp as those are live connceion points if it folds over and touch it can short out the curciut your gonna put the connector patches over the open point and your going toi put minimal pressure on the iron and just let the bond occur once thats all dry you should be all set and you can plug in your inverter nad see if it works
