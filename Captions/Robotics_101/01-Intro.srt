Hello everyone. This is Robert with SparkFun Electronics,

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,840
and welcome to our into to robotics video.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,766
In the past, we've typically only carried electronics

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,088
prototyping boards and things of that nature.

6
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:20,178
We really haven't carried all the components

7
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:22,267
you need to build your robot. Well, we are looking

8
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:24,589
to change that. We are vary proud to introduce the

9
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:27,283
Actobotics product line where we will be carrying

10
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:32,275
500 additional robotic components, strictly for robotics.

11
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:34,481
So, now you can have the electronics and

12
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:36,223
the robotic components all in one place

13
00:00:36,223 --> 00:00:37,987
and you don't have to go shopping around for everything.

14
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:40,565
This is the first of the 9 part video series where we

15
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:42,353
explain all the different components that go

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,768
into building a robot. We're going to talk about

17
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:47,299
belts, pulleys, gears, bearings, and all the other

18
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:48,878
things that you'll need to know to build your

19
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:50,294
very own robotic creation.

20
00:00:50,294 --> 00:00:51,966
Before we get into that let's first

21
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,684
talk about what is robotics.

23
00:00:57,306 --> 00:00:59,559
Robots are electromechanical systems designed

24
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,786
to typically to help people with tedious repetitive

25
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:05,898
and sometimes dangerous tasks. Robots are

26
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:09,032
comprised of actuators, being motors or

27
00:01:09,032 --> 00:01:12,469
servos; and sensors being user inputs or

28
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:15,186
electronic sensors. Robots are all around us.

29
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:17,206
From the dishwasher in our kitchen,

30
00:01:17,206 --> 00:01:19,899
to the robot vacuum cleaners cleaning our floors.

31
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:22,686
We even have robots on Mars. Robots are

32
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:25,031
essential to manufacturing. With the use of

33
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:27,028
automated welders to build our cars,

34
00:01:27,028 --> 00:01:30,813
to CNC machines to build our circuit boards. While robots

35
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:33,529
maybe useful, they're sometimes difficult to

36
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:35,642
design and build. There's motors,

37
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:37,547
there's sensors, there's computers,

38
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:40,147
and interfacing all these together is quite

39
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:42,539
a challenge crossing many disciplines.

40
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:44,721
Through this video series we are going to

41
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:46,695
try to give you some shortcuts in understanding

42
00:01:46,695 --> 00:01:48,367
some of these different disciplines.

44
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:53,592
So, when building a robot there's a lot

45
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:55,124
of different parts and pieces you're going to

46
00:01:55,124 --> 00:01:56,796
need. You're going to need anything from shafts,

47
00:01:56,796 --> 00:01:59,350
to wheels, to gears, to motors... The one thing

48
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,788
we really like about Actobotics is all the parts

49
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,435
work together. They have common hole spacing.

50
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:08,940
They've event got 0.77 inch or 1.5 inch that

51
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,866
all the parts use so they easily mate together

52
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,421
and you can use these in any different

53
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:15,418
configuration and you don't have to worry about

54
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:18,739
re-drilling or tapping a hole; it all just works

55
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,875
together nicely. So, be sure to join us next

56
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,547
week for the next installment of the robotic

57
00:02:22,547 --> 00:02:24,892
video series which will be angular motion.

58
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:26,355
We're going to be talking about: wheels,

59
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,538
barrings, shafts, and also all the different

60
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:29,977
types of motors that you could be using.

61
00:02:29,977 --> 00:02:31,928
So, see you then!

62
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:42,400
