00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:09,717
Hello everyone! This is Robert with SparkFun Electronics,

3
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,327
and this is the second video of our robotic video series.

4
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:13,731
And today we are going to be talking about

5
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,602
angular motion. Angular motion can be as simple as

6
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:20,154
rotating a wheel to drive a robot, or rotating some

7
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:22,732
kind of leaver or arm, or even like spinning a

8
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:24,613
rotisserie chicken. There's a lot of different ways

9
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:26,911
that you can apply angular motion to your robotic

10
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:28,096
project.

00:00:28,096 --> 00:00:30,557
[Transition Music]

12
00:00:30,557 --> 00:00:32,438
Motors convert electricity into mechanical

13
00:00:32,438 --> 00:00:35,642
power. They come in various shapes, sizes,

14
00:00:35,642 --> 00:00:38,196
and configurations. Brush motors are the

15
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:40,542
workhorse of robotics in industry.

16
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:43,073
They have a very good torque response curve

17
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:46,439
with a wide RPM range. They're very simple

18
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,713
to control requiring only two leads to be connected

19
00:00:49,713 --> 00:00:52,848
to a battery or power source. As the name would

20
00:00:52,848 --> 00:00:54,984
suggest, they have brushes. These brushes

21
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:58,026
translate power to a ring called the commutator.

22
00:00:58,026 --> 00:01:00,302
This commutator is essentially the controller

23
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:02,554
of a brush motor, supplying current to the

24
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:04,365
windings propelling the motor forward.

25
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:07,175
These brushes over time can wear out

26
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:09,636
and in some cases lead to inefficiencies

27
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,540
since they are made of carbon. This

28
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,073
is the same stuff resistors are made of.

29
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,977
Modern motors have solved this problem

30
00:01:14,977 --> 00:01:17,276
by using precious metals or special

31
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:19,644
compounds. One thing to note is

32
00:01:19,644 --> 00:01:21,571
servos are actually brush motors in disguise.

33
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:24,474
They have a little control loop inside that makes

34
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:25,635
them behave a little differently, but we'll get

35
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:27,632
into that later. Moving on to stepper motors,

36
00:01:27,632 --> 00:01:29,698
these are typically found in CNC machines,

37
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:31,997
3D printers, and anything else that requires

38
00:01:31,997 --> 00:01:35,248
high positioning accuracy. Stepper motors have

39
00:01:35,248 --> 00:01:38,197
exceptional holding torque, at the expanse of

40
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:41,076
higher RPM. Stepper motors are not quite as

41
00:01:41,076 --> 00:01:44,304
easy to control as compared to a DC brush motor.

42
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,345
They require an external driver which are inexpensive

43
00:01:47,345 --> 00:01:49,714
and easy to come by. Now let's take a look

44
00:01:49,714 --> 00:01:51,827
inside of a stepper motor. As you can see

45
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:54,845
the coils are stationary, and the magnet

46
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:57,980
assembly is actually what spins. This is different

47
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,372
from a brush motor, because it has no brushes.

48
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:03,158
What gives a stepper its name is these little

49
00:02:03,158 --> 00:02:05,085
grooves here. These are little teeth that

50
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:07,686
redirect the magnetic fields to create a

51
00:02:07,686 --> 00:02:09,683
much smaller, what's called, step distance.

52
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:11,750
And this is what gives the motor exceptional

53
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,373
holding torque. Moving on to brushless motors,

54
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:16,277
they're a little bit different then stepper

55
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:18,646
motors, but they share a lot of similarities.

56
00:02:18,646 --> 00:02:21,827
Both are spinning magnets verses the coils

57
00:02:21,827 --> 00:02:24,335
but brushless motors have a much larger,

58
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:26,634
what we would call, step distance. Where as

59
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:29,234
stepper motors usually have from 200 to 400

60
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:31,626
steps per revolution, brushless motors have

61
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:35,202
between 6 and 12. The advantages of this

62
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:37,570
are that they have a much higher operating

63
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,055
RPM, but the disadvantage is that they have

64
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:42,679
very low starting torque. They require very

65
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:45,651
specialized controllers to optimize for the

66
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:48,483
application of the user. With new controllers

67
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:50,550
coming out on the market, with the advent of

68
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,127
quad-copters and ground vehicles, brushless motors

69
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:54,985
are becoming more prevalent in robotics.

70
00:02:54,985 --> 00:02:57,098
So, how do I choose the right motor for my

71
00:02:57,098 --> 00:02:59,606
application? When I need things to be positioned

72
00:02:59,606 --> 00:03:02,206
accurately, or have a high holding torque,

73
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:04,737
I look to the stepper motor. When I need things

74
00:03:04,737 --> 00:03:06,874
to be very fast, I look to the brushless motor.

75
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:09,289
And for pretty much everything else, I look

76
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,075
to the DC brush motor. Now in future videos

77
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:15,024
we'll show how to take a brush motor

78
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:17,741
or a stepper motor and use it as a very precise

79
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,273
positioning system.

80
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:21,990
[Transition Music]

81
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,871
So let's talk about how to connect your

82
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,448
motors to the other various Actobotics components.

83
00:03:26,448 --> 00:03:28,793
We've got four of the different motor mounts

84
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:31,069
here. These mounts can actually be found on the

85
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:33,530
website under robotics, mounts and hubs,

86
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,666
and motor mounts. There's a whole category

87
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:39,033
just for the motor mounts. First up we've got the

88
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:41,866
Motor Mount A which looks a little something

89
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:43,120
like that; we've got the Motor Mount D;

90
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,047
we've got the Clamp Mount; and we've got the

91
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:48,437
Clamping Swivel Mount. Let's start with the A.

92
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:52,037
The A is good for connecting to the outside of

93
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:55,148
channels like this. So first what we need to do

94
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:58,863
is line up holes with these two holes located

95
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,674
on the face of the motor. This should be the

96
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,461
same for standard or the precision motors.

97
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:06,363
I'm just going to use two screws. There you go.

98
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:08,290
Now you have a versatile mount that can mount

99
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,914
to the outside of the Actobotics channels.

100
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:14,699
So if we use a quarter inch screw, we can

101
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:16,580
easily thread that through and attach this.

102
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,600
So now we have a secure connection to the

103
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,385
motor. Well, what if we want to mount on the inside

104
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:24,846
open part of the channel? We will want to use the

105
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:28,515
motor mount D. This mounts very similar to this one, but

106
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:30,280
mounts inside the channel like this.

107
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,602
So it's always a good idea, before you put this

108
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:35,551
in the channel, to get the shaft coupler attached

109
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:37,548
to your output shaft, just so you don't have to

110
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:39,266
go reach inside and screw this later.

111
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:41,031
Shaft couplers are basically these little

112
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,538
metal tubes that have these set screws on

113
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:45,257
each side, and one shaft goes in on side,

114
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:46,673
one shaft goes in the other side,

115
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:48,322
and you clamp them down and you can transfer

116
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:51,642
the motion from the shaft of your motor to another

117
00:04:51,642 --> 00:04:54,127
shaft, or you can even attach a wheel on the

118
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,706
other side. There's a lot of different types

119
00:04:55,706 --> 00:04:58,492
of shaft couplers and they come in two bores.

120
00:04:58,492 --> 00:05:01,905
The first bore is the size of the inner hole

121
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:05,017
size and the other bore is the size of the other

122
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:07,274
side. Now all we need to do is fit on our flange

123
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,102
bearing and the flange will keep it from going

124
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:15,081
inside the channel. There we go.

125
00:05:15,303 --> 00:05:17,229
We're going to use a plastic

126
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:19,072
shaft spacer that will give a little bit of a

127
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,564
buffer between that and our hub clamp which

128
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,023
we will then attach like this. So now that we

129
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,563
have the hub on the end of here, we have a

130
00:05:27,563 --> 00:05:30,675
0.77 inch hole pattern, that we can use to

131
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:34,088
attach any wheel that has a 0.77 inch hole

132
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:37,664
pattern, or with the use of an adapter we can

133
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:41,263
actually adapt it to a larger wheel, like this 1.5.

134
00:05:41,263 --> 00:05:44,468
Two more motor mounting options we have are

135
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:47,045
this motor clamp and also this swivel clamp.

136
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,715
The motor mount is actually pretty simple,

137
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:52,362
and all we need to do is line it up with a

138
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:57,471
1.5 inch hole pattern, like so, slide the motor

139
00:05:57,471 --> 00:06:01,279
in place, clamp down the set screw, and we've

140
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,833
got a really simple way to mount a motor.

141
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,712
The other benefit of this motor mount is that

142
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:09,220
since the motor can actually slide inside,

143
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,842
and the motor output shaft is offset, it acts

144
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:15,188
as an adjustment to adjust the motor

145
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:17,695
up and down, closer to what ever you are trying

146
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:19,762
to attach to. The swivel mount is very similar

147
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:22,966
to this one, except for it has a swiveling base.

148
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,265
This base connects to the channel in the same

149
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:28,655
way, but with the aid of this screw, it allows

150
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,954
you to adjust the orientation of the motor,

151
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:34,414
any which way you want. So these two together,

152
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:38,942
along with the rotation inside the channel,

153
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:42,355
gives you a very flexible motor mounting solution.

154
00:06:42,355 --> 00:06:44,979
What if you have two shafts that are slightly

155
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:47,695
misaligned. This is an example of a helical

156
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:50,389
coupler. It just has these spiral cuts which

157
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:53,152
allows for angular misalignment. You might not

158
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:55,497
be able to line up the shafts like this,

159
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:57,634
but if you have any angular misalignment,

160
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:00,002
that's exactly why you would use a helical

161
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,278
coupler. A traditional shaft coupler is going

162
00:07:02,278 --> 00:07:04,994
to be good for two shafts that are perfectly

163
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:07,084
aligned, a helical coupler is going to be

164
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:08,895
good for any shafts that have a little bit of angular

165
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,194
misalignment, but what if you have a parallel

166
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:13,446
offset? A parallel offset is where the two

167
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:15,397
shafts are like this, but there is a bit of

168
00:07:15,397 --> 00:07:17,417
an offset between them. It's really difficult

169
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:19,902
to transfer the motion between these two shafts,

170
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:21,991
when they are offset like that. So the best way

171
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:23,663
to deal with it would be to use

172
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:26,589
some sort of gear, pulley or belt system

173
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:28,864
and we'll be talking about those in later videos.

174
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,047
Wheels are going to be the most common thing

175
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:32,696
people are going to attach to the end of

176
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:34,135
a motor, because it makes things drive,

177
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:35,784
it makes things move, and it's pretty cool.

178
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:37,340
I've got a few different types of wheels

179
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,383
here, and the first thing you'll notice is

180
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:42,448
the actual width of the tread, or the thing that

181
00:07:42,448 --> 00:07:44,700
touches the ground. You've got a big wheel

182
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,417
here, this came off a wild thumper chassis, and

183
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,414
we've got one of these small wheels, which is

184
00:07:49,414 --> 00:07:51,202
an Actobotics precision disk wheel.

185
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:53,501
Now, why would you use this one over

186
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:55,312
this one? The procession disk wheel is going

187
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:58,354
to have a much better time turning precisely

188
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:00,467
especially on a flat smooth surface,

189
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:03,648
where as something like this is going to take

190
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:06,272
a lot more force to turn on a flat surface.

191
00:08:06,272 --> 00:08:08,826
This is not going to be turning handling type

192
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:12,100
wheel, where this is. That being said, the really

193
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,468
small profile of this wheel means that the

194
00:08:14,468 --> 00:08:17,557
overall weight of the robot is being spread out

195
00:08:17,557 --> 00:08:20,459
over a much smaller space, where as if you have

196
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,687
a very heavy robot sitting on this, the weight

197
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:26,009
is going to be spread out over a much larger

198
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:28,145
surface area, thus giving you little bit more

199
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:30,537
traction and also distribute the load a little

200
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:32,510
bit better. But why would you choose something

201
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,105
like a skate wheel, something like this,

202
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,495
or maybe a larger wheel like these heavy duty

203
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:41,071
wheels from Actobotics. These give you a little

204
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,232
bit of the best of both worlds. They have a

205
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,345
very narrow profile as you can see,

206
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:47,739
this one has a little bit more, but they are

207
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:50,199
also sturdy enough to handle a higher load.

208
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:51,928
Now something to take into consideration

209
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,832
with wheels is you have the RPM of the output

210
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,023
shaft but choosing two different sized wheels,

211
00:08:58,215 --> 00:09:01,300
is going to change how fast the robot can go.

212
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:03,562
If we take the outer circumference of this

213
00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:06,940
wheel, one revolution can go, let's say, this far,

214
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:10,357
but with this wheel however, it might be

215
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:13,823
like this far. So when designing a robot,

216
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:16,062
and designing the speed that you want it to go,

217
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:19,074
or even trying to decide the RPM of the motor,

218
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:21,919
you're going to have to consider the outer size

219
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:23,801
of the wheel or the overall circumference of

220
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:26,234
the wheel to determine how fast or how far

221
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:28,838
it can go per revolution. The basic concept

222
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:31,187
of angular motion is taking a motor and spinning

223
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:33,156
something else. Now in an ideal

224
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,347
world we have just a motor with some kind

225
00:09:35,506 --> 00:09:37,484
of wheel spinning on the end of it. Now the problem

226
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:39,074
with that thinking is there's always going to be

227
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,091
some sort of load exerted on that wheel,

228
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:44,227
or on that thing that's attached so we're going

229
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:46,435
to need bearings. There are several different

230
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:48,293
types of barrings and they all serve a little bit

231
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:50,135
different purpose. But generally, a bearing

232
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:51,897
is there to make sure that the motor spins

233
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:54,807
smoothly and quietly. They take a lot of the load

234
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,186
that is exerted against the output shaft

235
00:09:57,426 --> 00:10:00,508
of the motor. Some motors already have bearings

236
00:10:00,723 --> 00:10:03,216
in them, for example the stepper motor has a

237
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,853
pretty big bearing on the output shaft

238
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:07,606
and it is good at taking loads against the side

239
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:09,772
so if you push against the side of the

240
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:11,408
shaft it can actually handle that pretty

241
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,609
well; however, most motors, do not have

242
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:16,054
a bearing on the output shaft, so you'll need

243
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:18,352
to provide one yourself. Join us next week

244
00:10:18,556 --> 00:10:20,612
for the third video in the robotic series which

245
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:23,578
will be linear motion. Linear motion is a little

246
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,602
bit different from angular motion in that we

247
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,476
are interested in things moving in a linear

248
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:29,247
plane rather then a rotational plane.

249
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:30,797
So we'll see you again next week for

250
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:31,842
linear motion.
