1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,530
The core skills are icons which appear on all the

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,435
SparkFun product pages on our website.

3
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:07,221
They give you an idea of how hard a product is to use

4
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:10,588
or more importantly the barrier to entry for each one of the

5
00:00:10,588 --> 00:00:13,397
different products. The categories are separated into five

6
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:16,997
different core skills. There's soldering, programming,

7
00:00:16,997 --> 00:00:20,085
electrical prototyping, robotics, and DIY.

8
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:22,732
And each one of these five skills, have five different

9
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:26,586
skill levels. These five individual skills ranging from 1

10
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:29,744
the easiest, to 5 the most difficult give you an idea

11
00:00:29,744 --> 00:00:33,204
of roughly how difficult something is, or the barrier to entry.

12
00:00:33,204 --> 00:00:36,548
1 is defined as a Noob. This is someone that is

13
00:00:36,548 --> 00:00:40,867
completely new to this idea or concept and has never had any

14
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:43,583
exposure to it. For instance someone with programming

15
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,857
a level 1 is someone that has never even done drag

16
00:00:46,857 --> 00:00:49,458
and drop programming and they are very new to the concept

17
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:52,360
in general. Level 2 is a Rookie. A Rookie is

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,891
someone who has a little experience in this skill

19
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:59,582
but hasn't had any really formal training. In the example of programming

20
00:00:59,582 --> 00:01:01,440
they might have done something with drag and drop

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,413
and they might know some of the basics of programming

22
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:05,898
but they are going to need a descent amount of hand holding

23
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:07,686
to get through the different examples.

24
00:01:07,686 --> 00:01:11,842
Level 3 is Competent. This is someone who has some formal knowledge

25
00:01:11,842 --> 00:01:14,303
and some fundamental skill. This differs

26
00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:17,717
from level 1 and level 2 in that at level 3

27
00:01:17,717 --> 00:01:20,480
you really do need to have some sort of fundamentals

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,872
behind you before tackling this skill.

29
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:26,401
Level 4 is Experienced. At this level you really need

30
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:27,562
to know what you are doing, and you need

31
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:30,720
have a lot of background knowledge. It is almost impossible

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,599
to start out at a level 4. You might be able to start at

33
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,596
level 3 with a lot of blood sweat and tears,

34
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,872
but a Level 4 is going to be nearly impossible.

35
00:01:37,872 --> 00:01:41,378
Level 5 is Expert. At this level, most everything is

36
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:42,608
going to be completely up to you.

37
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:43,886
You're going to have to do your own research,

38
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:45,650
you're going to have to figure out everything by yourself,

39
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:47,949
and you are considered an expert in this skill.

40
00:01:47,949 --> 00:01:49,319
The next thing we'd like to talk about

41
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,268
is assumed application. There are many products in

42
00:01:52,268 --> 00:01:54,126
our catalog that can be used a lot of different

43
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:56,540
ways. They could be beginner for some but

44
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,119
you could also use them for much higher

45
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,695
applications. For our listing purposes, we choose

46
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:04,389
everything as the base barrier to entry,

47
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:06,688
based on the assumed application.

48
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:09,381
For instance, with an Arduino, we are putting

49
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:11,657
a level 2 with programming because, generally,

50
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:14,002
most things are relatively easy with the Arduino

51
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:16,394
but of course you can use it with a lot more

52
00:02:16,394 --> 00:02:19,157
complex applications. To determine the overall

53
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:21,734
difficulty level, or the barrier to entry for an entire

54
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:23,894
project, all we need to do is look at each

55
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,471
individual part that will go into the project

56
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:29,884
and then we just take highest number from all

57
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:32,021
the different skills, and that will be the

58
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,716
total barrier to entry. So, let's say

59
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:35,573
we have a project involving a stepper motor.

60
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,733
The stepper motor itself might not require

61
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:40,008
programming, but either the Arduino or

62
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:42,075
the driver that is driving the stepper motor

63
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:44,931
might. So, if we take the core skills from each

64
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,346
one of the three different aspects, the Arduino,

65
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:49,830
the stepper motor driver, and the stepper motor

66
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,175
itself and combine them and just take

67
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:54,288
the highest number from all the different core

68
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:56,680
skills, that gives you an idea of the barrier

69
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,683
to entry for the entire project.
